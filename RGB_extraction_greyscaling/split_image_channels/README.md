Author Name: Mann Manohar



## Description: 



The RGB Components Viewer is a MATLAB script designed to extract and visualize the individual color components (Red, Green, Blue) of an image. The application provides an easy way to understand the distribution of color channels in an image by displaying each channel separately.



## Features

- Interactive Visualization: Displays the original image along with its Red, Green, and Blue components in a 2x2 subplot layout.
- Color Channel Extraction: Processes the image to isolate and display each color component.



## How to run

1. Open the MATLAB environment.

2. Save the provided script as RGBComponentsViewer.m.

3. Place the image file (image.jpg) in the same directory as the script.

4. Run the script.

6. The original image and its color components will be displayed in separate subplots.
