   This practical demonstrates how to:
   - Read and display a color image.
   - Separate and visualize the Red, Green, and Blue components.
   - Convert the Red channel into grayscale.
   - Display a specific pixel's intensity value.

2. *Histogram Equalization Implementation for Grayscale Image*  
   This practical demonstrates how to:
   - Read and convert an image to grayscale
   - Calculate and visualize image histograms
   - Perform histogram equalization without built-in functions
   - Compare original and equalized images
   - Analyze intensity distributions using histograms and CDFs
   - Visualize the enhancement in image contrast

## Prerequisites

  1. MATLAB installed on your system.
