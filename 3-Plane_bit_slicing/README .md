## Greyscale Methods Viewer

Author Name: Mann Manohar



## Description: 



The Greyscale Methods Viewer is a MATLAB script designed to convert an image into greyscale using different algorithms. The application provides a comparative visualization of the various greyscaling techniques, showcasing their impact on the image.



## Features

- Interactive Visualization: Displays the original image along with its greyscaled versions using four different methods in a 2x2 subplot layout.
- Greyscale Algorithms: Implements and displays the following greyscale methods:

    - Average Method

    - Weighted Average Method

    - Luminosity Method

    - Desaturation Method



## How to run

1. Open the MATLAB environment.

2. Save the provided script as GreyscaleMethodsViewer.m.

3. Place the image file (image.jpg) in the same directory as the script.

4. Run the script.

6. The original image and its greyscaled versions will be displayed in separate subplots.
    
## Example Output

Below is an example output of the application after loading an image:

- The Average Method greyscaled image is displayed in the first subplot.
- The Weighted Average Method greyscaled image is displayed in the second subplot.
- The Luminosity Method greyscaled image is displayed in the third subplot.
- The Desaturation Method greyscaled image is displayed in the fourth subplot.


## Supported Image Formats

- .jpg

- .png

- .bmp


## Notes

- Ensure that the image file (image.jpg) is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the image.

- The script displays the greyscaled images in a consistent 2x2 subplot layout for easy comparison.
